## Multi Factor ANOVA for 8 Business Indices over 18 years

###Overview of ANOVA Procedure:

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical procedure of analyzing the
differences between the group means. In this project of analyzing eight business
indices over the past 18 years, we intend to use ANOVA method to examine if
the factors reporting agency and year effect the business index and their
significance

In addition to the examining the mentioned factors, we aim to study:

> Specific Model by considering the dataset as the population, and
conducting Fixed Effects ANOVA model analysis
> General Model by considering the dataset as a sample of a larger
population, and conducting Random Effects ANOVA model analysis


## Analysis of Factors Affecting Hg Levels in Kuwaiti Fishermen â€“ A Multilinear Regression

###Overview of the Regression Analysis Procedure:

Multi-linear regression analysis is used to find and explain linear relationships
of the considered predictors with the response variable. In this project we find
the factors that most influence Total Mercury level in the hair of Fishermen
since Mercury is a hazardous substance and its content in the human must not
exceed the safe threshold.

We use best subset selection methods to determine the best predictors and also
compare models using Adjusted R2 values. Residual plots are employed to
confirm the viability of our preferred models, check for normality assumptions
and observe for any unexplained variances.
